# Animated-Circle
You can control a circle by changing the speed values ​​and clicking on it to stop or back to move, it's a begginer project built by myself. Anything you've seen and can improve, share it with me, I'm here to learn
The Start button turn the circle back to movement, if you're already moving it does nothing.
The Stop button stop the movement, and if you're not on movement, nothing happens.
When the circle get to the width limit, it turn back to the start, and repeat it.
The + and - buttons respectively increase and decrease the speed of the circle. The speed can be increased unlimitedly, but can only be decrease at 1px/s.
You can also click on the circle to change the movement.
Anything you would like me to improve at the code, just say it (i'll do my best).
